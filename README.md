# üéâüíªConnect 2019 React+Python Code Lab

Prompt:

* Intro to React - [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/)
  * React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called ‚Äúcomponents‚Äù.
  * Declarative
React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
  * Component-Based
Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.
  * Learn Once, Write Anywhere
We don‚Äôt make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.
React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.

* Intro to Python/Django - [Python Docs](https://www.python.org/) | [Django Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/)
  * Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.
  * Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.
  * Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.
  * The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.
  * Django was designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible.
  * Django includes dozens of extras you can use to handle common Web development tasks. Django takes care of user authentication, content administration, site maps, RSS feeds, and many more tasks ‚Äî right out of the box.
  * Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many common security mistakes, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery and clickjacking. Its user authentication system provides a secure way to manage user accounts and passwords.
